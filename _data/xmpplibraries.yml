It supports all environments which run Java including desktop Java, Android, GWT and other. Our XMPP Chat clients Stork IM for Android and GWT web clients are implemented using the library. We also use the library to develop XMPP command line tools and automated tests.

    headtext1: Our software philosophy
    desc4: Actually nothing new and nothing surprising here. We want to have as much of a reusable code as possible. And this reusable code should have a simple but powerful API to be useful for quickly creating software.
    desc5: That’s it.
    desc6: And this is how we design and develop our XMPP libraries. Check them out.
    desc7: Documentation to all our projects is available online and sample codes? Take a look at our XMPP Chat apps which are open source too.
