    text015:  What We Accomplished So Far
    text17: Tigase is an open source project started by Artur Hefczyc in October 2004 to develop an XMPP server implementation in Java. Initially the goal was to develop a fully compliant XMPP server with backward compatibility with an informal XMPP specification.

    text32: Tigase XMPP Server
    text33: Tigase XMPP Server is our flagship server software writen in Java to build Instant Communication (IC) systems. The most basic explanation is that Tigase is a chat server, but it is so much more than just that.
    text34: Always Online
    text35: The main requirement for a real-time and instant communication is having all parties online all the time. Tigase XMPP Server can handle practically unlimited number of long-lasting concurrent connections from users or devices to the system.
    text36: Presence
    text37: XMPP systems keep users and devices connected and online for a long time. Most of the time. This makes them available to receive messages and other data. Until... they are not online. Or perhaps they are online but busy and unavailable.
    text38: Messaging
    text39: XMPP is known for chat systems. Chat means sending and receiving messages, hence 'Messaging' in name. But Tigase is so much more than sending messages, chatting. It's all aboutus communication between people and devices.
    text40: Mobile Optimizations
    text41: XMPP like most other systems were designed in pre-mobile era. By design they are intended for desktop use. Tigase, however, put a lot of effort to add custom optimizations and mechanisms for mobile devices to lower battery usage, devices after connection was lost.
